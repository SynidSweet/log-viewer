**Description**: Investigate 2.20x memory growth exceeding 2.0x threshold

### 2. TASK-2025-081: Create GitHub Actions workflow documentation  
**Priority**: Low  
**Location**: Backlog (not sprint-critical)  
**Description**: Team documentation for workflow usage and maintenance

## 🎯 Sprint Task Decision Framework Applied

### Memory Optimization Task (TASK-2025-080)
- ✅ **Sprint Relevance**: Directly serves performance optimization objective
- ✅ **Logical Grouping**: Complements existing performance work  
- ✅ **Dependency Check**: Related to completed CI/CD integration
- ✅ **Scope Boundary**: Within performance optimization scope
- **Decision**: Added to sprint

### Documentation Task (TASK-2025-081)  
- ⚠️ **Sprint Relevance**: Support task, not core performance objective
- ⚠️ **Logical Grouping**: Administrative, not performance optimization
- ❌ **Scope Boundary**: Outside core performance optimization scope
- **Decision**: Remains in backlog

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1. **Trigger**: PR/push to performance-critical files
2. **Setup**: Node.js 20, npm dependencies, performance config
3. **Execution**: Jest performance tests + standalone benchmarks
4. **Analysis**: Threshold validation, trend comparison
5. **Reporting**: PR comments, artifact storage, issue creation
6. **History**: Baseline storage for future comparisons

### Configuration Hierarchy
- **Global Config**: `.claude-testing/performance-config.json`
- **Jest Config**: `.claude-testing/jest.config.performance.js`
- **Workflow Config**: `.github/workflows/performance.yml`
- **Package Scripts**: `package.json` performance commands
