      "description": "Comprehensive frontend improvements for the log entries list (second column) including: 1) Ascending/descending sort button, 2) DEBUG log type support (frontend + backend), 3) _tags field support with badge display and filtering dropdown. Primary objective: Enhanced user experience with sorting, filtering, and visual organization of log entries. Validation criteria: Sort functionality works correctly, DEBUG logs are supported end-to-end, tags display as badges and filter properly. In-scope: UI enhancements, backend log type extension, tag parsing and display. Out-of-scope: Performance optimizations beyond basic functionality, other log types, advanced tag features like editing.",
