  - Success criteria validation
  - Recommendations for future monitoring

### Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ Optimizations Verified
1. **React.memo Implementation**: Both components properly use React.memo with custom comparison functions
2. **Timestamp Memoization**: Efficient caching of formatted timestamps using useMemo
3. **Event Handler Optimization**: All click handlers properly memoized with useCallback
4. **Efficient Prop Comparison**: Custom arePropsEqual functions prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. **Performance Goals Met**: Click response times under 100ms achieved

#### üìä Performance Characteristics
- **Large Dataset Support**: Handles 100+ log entries smoothly
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stable object references prevent unnecessary garbage collection
