# Current Project Focus

*Last updated: 2025-07-17 | Testing infrastructure improved - import path standardization completed*

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Optimize the log viewer frontend for smooth user experience and stabilize the codebase with comprehensive testing and documentation. Eliminate performance bottlenecks in log entry rendering and filtering to achieve smooth, responsive user interaction when clicking between logs and entries.

## ✅ Validation Criteria
Achievement is measured by completing ALL of these:
- [⚡] Click response time <100ms when switching between log entries (Improved - callback optimization done)
- [⚡] No unnecessary re-renders during normal user interactions (Improved - LogItem/LogEntryList memoized)
- [✅] All console.log statements removed from production code (COMPLETED - TASK-2025-065)
- [ ] Test coverage ≥90% for all log viewer components
- [⚡] Documentation updated with performance guidelines (In Progress - patterns documented)
- [⚡] Component complexity reduced via proper memoization and separation (Improved - components well-memoized)

## 📋 Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Performance optimization and memoization of React components
- Elimination of console.log statements from production code
- Component refactoring for performance (breaking down large components)
- Testing infrastructure setup and comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation updates with performance guidelines
- Memory optimization and re-render prevention

### Out of Scope
- New features or additional functionality
- UI design changes or visual enhancements  
- API modifications or backend optimizations
- Database performance optimizations
- Additional authentication methods
- Monitoring/alerting system setup
- New integrations or external service connections

## 🚧 Current Status
**Progress**: 1 of 6 validation criteria fully complete, 4 significantly improved - console cleanup and testing infrastructure stabilized
**Status**: Sprint 62.5% complete (10/16 tasks) - performance optimization showing strong progress, latest achievement: config cleanup

## 📝 Focus Guidelines
1. All work must directly contribute to performance optimization goals
2. Prioritize React component memoization and re-render prevention
3. Eliminate console.log statements systematically across codebase
4. Focus on measurable performance improvements (<100ms response time)
5. Maintain existing functionality while optimizing performance
