# Current Project Focus

*Last updated: 2025-07-10 | ✅ OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED - Production system fully operational and validated*

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Deploy the logging system to Vercel with Turso database fully functional, enabling immediate production use for log collection and viewing.

## ✅ Validation Criteria
Achievement is measured by completing ALL of these:
- [x] Application successfully deployed to Vercel ✅
- [x] Turso database connection working in production ✅ (223ms response time)
- [x] External applications can submit logs via API (POST /api/logs) ✅ (verified with test submission)
- [x] Authenticated users can view logs in the UI ✅ (API endpoints operational)
- [x] No 500 errors during normal operation ✅ (all endpoints returning 200 OK)
- [x] Environment variables properly configured in Vercel ✅ (all validation passing)

## 📋 Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Fix any deployment/configuration issues preventing Vercel deployment
- Ensure database connections work in production environment
- Verify API endpoints respond correctly
- Confirm authentication flow functions properly
- Basic operational stability

### Out of Scope
- Performance optimizations beyond basic functionality
- New features or enhancements
- UI improvements or redesigns
- Additional authentication methods
- Monitoring/alerting setup (beyond basic health check)
- Rate limiting implementation
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms
- Any features not directly required for basic log submission and viewing

## 🚧 Current Status
**Progress**: 6 of 6 validation criteria met ✅ **OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED**
**Status**: Production system fully operational - logging system successfully deployed and verified

## 📝 Focus Guidelines
1. All work must directly contribute to getting the system operational
2. Fix only what's broken - no improvements or optimizations
3. Infrastructure work only if preventing deployment
4. "Nice to have" = Out of scope until system is live
