# Implementation Plan

*Last updated: 2025-07-16 | Template for tracking feature development tasks*

## Overview

This document serves as a template for tracking implementation tasks and feature development. It follows a structured approach to break down complex features into manageable tasks with clear priorities and success criteria.

## Task Template

### Feature Name
**Priority**: Critical | High | Medium | Low  
**Timeline**: Estimated completion time  
**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Completed  

**Description**: Brief description of the feature or improvement

**Benefits**:
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2
- Benefit 3

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] TASK-001: Task description (游릭 30 mins)
- [ ] TASK-002: Task description (游리 1.5 hours)
- [ ] TASK-003: Task description (游댮 4 hours)

**Dependencies**: List any blocking dependencies  
**Risks**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies  
**Success Criteria**: Clear definition of completion  

## Current Development Status

The Universal Log Viewer is in active development with core functionality implemented. New features and improvements should be tracked using this template.

## Task Priority Guidelines

### Critical
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- Complete system failures
- Production blockers

### High
- User experience improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Important bug fixes
- Core feature enhancements

### Medium
- Code quality improvements
- Non-critical feature additions
- Documentation updates
- Development tooling

### Low
- Nice-to-have features
- Minor optimizations
- Cosmetic improvements
- Optional enhancements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
Tasks that establish the groundwork for the feature
- Environment setup
- Dependencies installation
- Base architecture

### Phase 2: Core Implementation  
Main feature development
- Core functionality
- API implementations
- Database changes

### Phase 3: Enhancement
Additional features and improvements
- User interface enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling

### Phase 4: Validation
Testing and verification
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end validation

### Phase 5: Deployment
Production rollout
- Deployment preparation
- Production testing
- Documentation updates

### Phase 6: Cleanup
Post-deployment tasks
- Remove temporary code
- Update documentation
- Performance monitoring

## Estimation Guidelines

### Time Estimates
- 游릭 Quick (< 1 hour): Simple changes, configuration updates
- 游리 Medium (1-4 hours): Feature implementation, API changes
- 游댮 Complex (> 4 hours): Architectural changes, major features

### Complexity Indicators
- **Simple**: Well-defined, clear implementation path
- **Moderate**: Some complexity, standard patterns
- **Complex**: Significant architectural changes, new patterns

## Success Criteria Template

Define clear, measurable success criteria for each task:

- **Functional**: Feature works as intended
- **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
- **Quality**: Code quality standards met
- **Documentation**: Adequate documentation provided
- **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage

## Risk Management

### Common Risks
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulation of shortcuts
- **Scope Creep**: Feature expansion during development
- **Integration Issues**: Problems with existing systems
- **Performance Impact**: Negative effect on system performance

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular code reviews
- Incremental development
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance monitoring

## Documentation Requirements

Each implementation should update:
- API documentation (if applicable)
- User documentation (if applicable)
- Technical documentation
- Code comments and README files

## Example Implementation

### User Authentication Enhancement
**Priority**: High  
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Status**: Not Started  

**Description**: Add support for additional OAuth providers

**Benefits**:
- Improved user accessibility
- Reduced authentication friction
- Better user experience

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] AUTH-001: Research additional OAuth providers (游릭 1 hour)
- [ ] AUTH-002: Update NextAuth.js configuration (游리 2 hours)
- [ ] AUTH-003: Add provider selection UI (游리 3 hours)
- [ ] AUTH-004: Test authentication flows (游리 2 hours)
- [ ] AUTH-005: Update documentation (游릭 1 hour)

**Dependencies**: None  
**Risks**: Authentication flow complexity  
**Success Criteria**: 
- Users can authenticate with multiple providers
- Authentication flows are tested and working
- Documentation is updated

This template ensures consistent planning and tracking of implementation tasks throughout the project lifecycle.
