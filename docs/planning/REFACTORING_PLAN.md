# Refactoring Plan

*Last updated: 2025-07-10 | Technical debt and improvement opportunities*

## Overview

This document tracks identified technical debt and improvement opportunities in the Universal Log Viewer project. Items are categorized by impact and effort to help prioritize refactoring work.

## Critical Priority Issues

### 0. Database Reliability and Resilience Architecture
**Issue**: No database connection resilience, health checks, or failure handling
**Impact**: Critical - complete application failure when database is unavailable
**Effort**: Medium - requires architectural changes and new infrastructure
**Benefits**: Improved reliability, better user experience, proactive issue detection

**Root Cause**: Database deactivation due to inactivity exposed fundamental reliability gaps
**Investigation ID**: INV-2025-001

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] REF-DB-001: Refactor database connection layer with connection pooling
- [ ] REF-DB-002: Implement circuit breaker pattern for database operations
- [ ] REF-DB-003: Add comprehensive error handling with specific database error types
- [ ] REF-DB-004: Create database connection abstraction layer
- [ ] REF-DB-005: Implement graceful degradation patterns
- [ ] REF-DB-006: Add database connection caching and connection reuse
- [ ] REF-DB-007: Create database operation timeout handling
- [ ] REF-DB-008: Implement database connection validation middleware
- [ ] ARCH-DB-001: Design database failover strategy
- [ ] ARCH-DB-002: Create database backup and recovery architecture
- [ ] ARCH-DB-003: Design monitoring and alerting system architecture

**Complexity**: ðŸŸ¡ Moderate (requires architectural changes but well-defined patterns)
**Success Criteria**: 
- Database connectivity issues don't cause application crashes
- Health check endpoints return accurate database status
- Automated recovery from transient database failures
- Proactive alerting before database issues affect users

**Note**: This issue is being addressed through the **Turso Migration** (Section 0.1 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) which will eliminate the root cause by moving to a database without inactivity timeouts.

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Client-Side Log Parsing Performance
**Issue**: All log parsing happens in the browser, which can be slow for large logs
**Impact**: High - affects user experience with large log files
**Effort**: Medium - requires API changes and server-side parsing logic
**Benefits**: Faster load times, better user experience, reduced client memory usage

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Create server-side log parsing utilities
- [ ] Add parsed log storage to database schema
- [ ] Implement pagination for large log sets
- [ ] Update API endpoints to return parsed data
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### 2. Missing Test Coverage
**Issue**: No automated tests for critical functionality
**Impact**: High - risk of regressions and difficult maintenance
**Effort**: High - requires comprehensive test setup
**Benefits**: Better code quality, safer refactoring, improved reliability

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Add unit tests for database operations (`lib/db.ts`)
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add component tests for log viewer functionality
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with test automation

### 3. Database Schema Flexibility
**Issue**: Current schema is rigid and doesn't support easy evolution
**Impact**: Medium - limits future feature development
**Effort**: High - requires data migration strategy
**Benefits**: Better extensibility, easier feature additions

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Design versioned schema system
- [ ] Create migration utilities
- [ ] Implement backward compatibility layer
- [ ] Gradual migration of existing data

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Error Handling Consistency
**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across components and APIs
**Impact**: Medium - affects debugging and user experience
**Effort**: Low - mostly code cleanup
**Benefits**: Better debugging, consistent user experience

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Standardize error response formats
- [ ] Create error boundary components
- [ ] Implement consistent error logging
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages

### 5. Component State Management
**Issue**: Complex state logic in LogViewer component
**Impact**: Medium - affects maintainability
**Effort**: Medium - requires careful refactoring
**Benefits**: Better code organization, easier testing

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Extract state management to custom hooks
- [ ] Implement reducer pattern for complex state
- [ ] Split LogViewer into smaller components
- [ ] Add proper component boundaries

### 6. API Rate Limiting
**Issue**: No rate limiting on log submission endpoint
**Impact**: Medium - potential for abuse
**Effort**: Low - can use Vercel platform features
**Benefits**: Better security, resource protection

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add per-project rate limits
- [ ] Monitor and alert on rate limit violations
- [ ] Document rate limits for API users

## Low Priority Issues

### 7. CSS Organization
**Issue**: Inline Tailwind classes getting complex
**Impact**: Low - affects code readability
**Effort**: Low - mostly code organization
**Benefits**: Better maintainability, reusable styles

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Extract common style patterns to CSS classes
- [ ] Create design system documentation
- [ ] Implement style guide and linting rules

### 8. Bundle Size Optimization
**Issue**: Could optimize bundle size further
**Impact**: Low - minor performance improvement
**Effort**: Low - analyze and optimize imports
**Benefits**: Faster load times, better performance

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- [ ] Implement code splitting where beneficial
- [ ] Optimize third-party library imports
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies

## Future Enhancements

### 9. Real-Time Log Streaming
**Issue**: Currently batch-based log viewing
**Impact**: Enhancement - would improve user experience
**Effort**: High - requires WebSocket implementation
**Benefits**: Live log monitoring, better debugging experience

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Design WebSocket architecture
- [ ] Implement server-side streaming
- [ ] Add client-side real-time updates
- [ ] Handle connection management and reconnection

### 10. Advanced Log Analysis
**Issue**: Limited log analysis capabilities
**Impact**: Enhancement - would add significant value
**Effort**: High - requires complex analysis logic
**Benefits**: Better insights, automated problem detection

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Implement log pattern recognition
- [ ] Add error correlation features
- [ ] Create dashboard and analytics views
- [ ] Add alerting capabilities

## Refactoring Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict type checking
- **Testing**: All new code must have tests
- **Documentation**: Update docs for architectural changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility during transitions

### Refactoring Process
